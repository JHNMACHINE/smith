"""smith: an agent for training nodes. Takes jobs from a backend's queue and runs them here.

    python smith.py --config smith.toml

The backend never starts a training: it may be a container with no torch and
no GPU, or have no process to start at all. It keeps a queue; smith runs where
the training environment actually is - a laptop's venv, a container, a rented
GPU node - takes a job, starts it, streams its output and says how it went.

**It runs scripts it was given, never commands it was sent.** A job names a
script from the ``[scripts]`` table of this agent's own configuration, and its
parameters become ``--name value`` flags whose names the backend has already
held to what a flag can be. An agent that ran a command line taken from an API
would be a remote shell on every training machine.

**What a job becomes.** A process running the script with

- ``RAVEX_STORAGE_PATH``: a new store under ``runs`` for a fresh run or a
  fork, the run's own store for a resume;
- ``RAVEX_RUN_ID`` and ``RAVEX_NAME`` for a fresh run or a fork, so the run
  the backend shows has the name it was given and an id this agent knows before
  Ravex starts;
- ``RAVEX_FORK_FROM`` and ``RAVEX_FORK_STEP`` for a fork, which is a fresh
  run of its own starting from another run's checkpoint;
- ``RAVEX_METRICS_ENDPOINT``: the backend, so Ravex sends the run there while
  it trains, and ``RAVEX_METRICS_TOKEN`` with the agent's token when
  the backend asks for one.

**Code from a repository.** An agent started with ``code = true`` (or
``SMITH_CODE=1``) also takes jobs that carry ``code``: a repository over
HTTPS, a commit as a full SHA, and the name of a manifest file in it. The job
names a script from the manifest's ``[scripts]`` table - the same shape as
this file's - instead of one of the agent's own. Before it starts, the job's
process fetches that commit alone into ``runs/_code/<repository>/<commit>``,
makes a virtual environment beside it when the repository has a
``requirements.txt`` or a ``pyproject.toml`` (on top of this Python's own
packages, so torch and Ravex are there already; with ``uv`` when it is
installed) and then runs the script with the job's parameters as flags. A
commit already fetched is used again. Every step is in the job's output. It
is still never a command: a repository, a commit and a name, each checked.
It is opt-in because it runs whatever the repository holds: on a machine of
the person whose repository it is, or one rented for them, that is the point;
on a machine shared with others, leave it off. A private repository's token
comes with the job and reaches git through its environment, never its
command line, and never the training process.

**One run on several nodes.** A job that is one node's part of a run trained
by several - Ravex's outer loop - says so in ``outer``: ``member``, the name of
this node's own store inside the run's (two nodes writing one store would
overwrite each other); ``token``, the run's ``RAVEX_JOB_TOKEN``, which keeps
anyone else out of its rendezvous; and on the node that hosts it, ``serve``:
the port of a ``ravex rendezvous`` this agent starts beside the script and
keeps serving after it, for the nodes still training, until it takes its next
job. Where the rendezvous is and what the run's settings are come
in the job's ``config``, like any other run's. Nothing in ``outer`` is a
command: the agent runs Ravex's own server, on a port.

**Where a run's store lives.** On a disk of this machine under ``runs``, or -
with a ``[storage]`` table - in a bucket, under ``<prefix>/<run id>``, with
the local directory only as Moonclip's staging copy. A rented node
is gone once it stops; a store in the bucket is what lets "Resume" and "Fork"
work on another one. The run reports ``s3://bucket/prefix`` as its address,
and a resume or fork on any agent with the same bucket starts from there. The
bucket's keys come from the environment, ``RAVEX_S3_ACCESS_KEY`` and
``RAVEX_S3_SECRET_KEY``, never from this file; the jobs inherit them.

**The token.** ``SMITH_TOKEN`` in the environment (or ``token`` in the
configuration, for a machine where that is how secrets arrive): sent as a
bearer token on every call, and handed to the runs and to ``ravex ship``.

**On a rented pod** one image serves every machine, so what differs between
them comes from the environment and wins over the file: ``SMITH_BACKEND``,
``SMITH_NAME``, ``SMITH_HARDWARE``, ``SMITH_GPUS``, and ``SMITH_STORAGE_TYPE``,
``_BUCKET``, ``_PREFIX``, ``_ENDPOINT``, ``_REGION``, ``_PATH_STYLE`` for the bucket.

Its output goes to ``runs/_logs/job-<id>.log``, and from there to the backend
a few seconds at a time, numbered line by line, so whoever watches the backend sees it while
it runs - a traceback from a job that died at import included.

**Stopping.** A job cancelled on the backend is noticed at the next report, and
the process is interrupted the way Ctrl-C would: Ravex sees a
``KeyboardInterrupt``, writes its final checkpoint and records the run as
``interrupted``. One that has not exited a minute later is killed.

**What a run could not send.** A run that ends while the backend is down does
not wait for it - Ravex keeps the unsent metrics on disk for the next
execution on that store, and a finished run never gets one. This agent
outlives the run and sits beside its store, so after every job it runs
``ravex ship`` on it, again every half minute until the backend has it all.
Without that, the first end-to-end test left a run showing ``running`` forever
with four fifths of its points missing.

Only the standard library, so it runs in whatever environment the training
does without adding to it. Python 3.11 or newer, for ``tomllib``.
